Requirements & Installation

Clone the repository or download the script.

Install dependencies:

os, shutil, datetime, and time are built-in Python libraries (no extra installation needed).

Update the script with your own folder paths:

source_dir = "C:/Path/To/Source/Folder"
destination_dir = "C:/Path/To/Backup/Directory"

Usage

Save the script as backup.py.

Activate your virtual environment (optional but recommended).

Run the script:
